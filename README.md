This game was developed according to diagrams made in the Enterprise Architect software. The programming language used was Python (and libraries like Pygame, PySimpleGUI and Pandas).

It is a Magic-style card game. Greek, Norse and Egyptian mythologies provided the characters with certain scores on each card. The game can be played against an artificial intelligence that has been developed, or against another human player on the same screen, offline.
